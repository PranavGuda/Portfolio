       <p class="col-sm-9 text-left" >I am Pranav Guda and I plan to become a Marketing VP of a large scale company with a salary of 200K+. I plan to do really good in highschool, get into a good college and excel in that college, get my master in business, then start off as a business analyst and work myself up the marketing route over time.<br></br>
	      I have started prepping for this job already participating in the DECA club in my school where you learn about marketing, stocks, and you learn about how to interview properly. I am also three math courses ahead of my baseline math course which gives me an advantage over a lot of people trying to get into college. I am very persistent in getting what I want, for example, I was not able to into algebra during my eighth grade year because I was one point off the requirement. I asked my parents to let the district give me another test. This time around I studied hard for it and aced the test. I am also very innovative. In eighth grade during a project where we had limited resources and had to get a marble onto a table without touching the ground. I created a two way pully contraption which let me get the marble up to the table in the most efficient way.<br></br>
	      Some skills that I have are that I can work good in a team, I can finish work fast, and I do not procrastinate. In eighth grade during a community service project, my team and I got 100% because I was able to identify weaknesses in our project and I was able to assign people to different parts of the project to make sure that we were able to create a well rounded project. I am always able to finish work fast, during that same service project my team and I were able to get through each task very quickly but still producing high quality work and finished 1 week before the project dead line. I do not procrastinate very often, during my eighth grade year in english my teacher assigned a reading and questions due in a month. I consistently read the book and finished in a week and half.<br></br>
        In my engineering experience, I have worked with Python, HTML, and CSS. I have html and css to make my personal website and I have used python to either build algorithms, or build games. Right Now I am trying to learn Java Script so I can enhance my website making skills and can hopefully use these skills as a temporary source to get income in the future.<br></br>
	      Overall I am very committed to becoming a Marketing VP because of the activities I am in, the skills I display, and the characteristics I have. Thank you for your reading my website.
